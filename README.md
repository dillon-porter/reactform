~ For some reason the react form will not work through Github Pages! :( 

     * Challenge: Connect the form to local state
     * 
     * 1. Create a state object to store the 4 values we need to save.
     * 2. Create a single handleChange function that can
     *    manage the state of all the inputs and set it up
     *    correctly
     * 3. When the user clicks "Sign up", check if the 
     *    password & confirmation match each other. If
     *    so, log "Successfully signed up" to the console.
     *    If not, log "passwords to not match" to the console.
     * 4. Also when submitting the form, if the person checked
     *    the "newsletter" checkbox, log "Thanks for signing
     *    up for our newsletter!" to the console.
